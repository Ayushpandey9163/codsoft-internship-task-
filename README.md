Below is a sample README file of this GitHub repository that contains four tasks: Number Guessing Game, Simple Calculator, Tic-Tac-Toe Game, and To-Do List, all written in C++.


# C++ Projects Repository

This repository contains four simple C++ console-based applications:

1. [Number Guessing Game](#number-guessing-game)
2. [Simple Calculator](#simple-calculator)
3. [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](#tic-tac-toe-game)
4. [To-Do List Manager](#to-do-list-manager)

Each application is designed to demonstrate basic programming concepts and provide a fun, interactive experience.

## Number Guessing Game

### Description
A simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

### Features
- Random number generation
- User input for guesses
- Feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low
- Option to play again

### How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

   g++ -o numberguessinggame NumberguessingGame.cpp

2. Run the executable:
   
   ./numberguessinggame
   

## Simple Calculator

### Description
A basic calculator program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two user-provided numbers.

### Features
- User input for two numbers
- Selection of arithmetic operation
- Output of the result
- Error handling for division by zero

### How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

   g++ -o calculator simplecalculator.cpp
   
2. Run the executable:
      ./calculator


## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

### Description
A console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. Players take turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game is a draw.

### Features
- 3x3 game board
- Two-player mode
- Input validation
- Win and draw detection

### How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
   
   g++ -o tictactoe tictactoe.cpp
  
2. Run the executable:

   ./tictactoe
   

## To-Do List Manager

### Description
A simple console-based to-do list manager that allows users to add, view, mark as completed, and delete tasks.

### Features
- Add tasks
- View tasks with status (completed or pending)
- Mark tasks as completed
- Remove tasks from the list

### How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
   
   g++ -o todolist todolist.cpp
   
2. Run the executable:
   
   ./todolist
